Last week, someone introduced me to another person by saying, "This is Shasha. She works for the company that makes SpongeBob". I love this cute introduction, although I still can not enjoy SpongeBob after trying to watch it twice. But I enjoyed watching some other good shows over the last two years. Here is an incomplete list of them:

| Show Name   | Seasons | Release years   | Watch Year   |  Watch Platform  | Short Comment|
| :---        | :-----  | :----           | :----        | :----            | :----        |
| A Gentleman in Moscow | 1 | 2024        | 2024         | Paramount+       | deep, decent |
| Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story | 1 | 2023 | 2024  | Netflix          | funny, sad   |
| Bridgerton  | 1       | 2020            | 2024         | Netflix          | funny        |
| Cheers      | 1-2     | 1982-1983       | 2024         | Paramount+       | funny        |
| Colin from Accounts | 1 | 2022          | 2024         | Paramount+       | funny        |

I will add more shows to this list :)
