I work for a movie company. But I was never a big fan of movies until last summer in 2023 when some colleague and friend I met in NYC told me that movies disseminate various cultures and shape lives. Since then, I started to watch more movies and will continue to do so. Therefore, I found it would be fun to list all the movies I've watched since the middle of last year, arranged chronologically according to my viewing dates. And I will keep adding movies to the list in the future!
