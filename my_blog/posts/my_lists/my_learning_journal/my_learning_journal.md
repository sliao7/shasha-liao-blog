People often mention GIGO(Garbage In, Garbage Out) to stress the importance of high-quality data when training machine learning models. This rule also applies to our human brain. Although a large part of the information fed to our brain is not controlled by ourselves, we have a certain degree of freedom to choose what we take into our minds. Therefore, we should be mindful and strategic about choosing the right knowledge and ideas for our smart and powerful brains to achieve our goals. On this page, I track the learning and training materials I have chosen intentionally to feed the neural networks in my brain:

- [Courses](course_list.md)
- [Language Training](boldvoice_training_track.md)
- [Sessions and Events](event_list.md)
