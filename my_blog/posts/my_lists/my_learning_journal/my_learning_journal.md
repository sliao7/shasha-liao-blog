People often mention GIGO(Garbage In, Garbage Out) to stress the importance of high-quality data when training machine learning models. I believe this rule also applies to our human brain. Although a large part of the information fed to our brain is not controlled by ourselves, we should try our best to take in as much good knowledge and ideas as possible to achieve our goals. On this page, I track the good information I have chosen to feed the neural networks in my brain:

- [Courses](course_list.md)
- Language Training
  - [BoldVoice Pronounciation Training log](boldvoice_training_track.md)
  - [My Vocabulary](my_vocabulary.md)
  - [Dictionary of American Idioms](Dictionary_of_American_Idioms_.pdf)
  - [Dictionary of American Slang and Colloquial Expressions](dictionary_of_american_slang_and_colloquial_expressions2.pdf)
- [Sessions and Events](event_list.md)
