| [apron](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apron)   | aprons                                    | life/grocery/cooking | I suddently had the desire to buy a new apron this evening. So, I first went to TJMax, but it closed right after I got there. Then I went to a store selling kitchen stuff at Ponce City Market. It was closed as well. Since I wanted it so badly that I didn't want to give up easily, I went to Kroger to try my luck. Thankfully, it was open. However, I couldn't find it after checking the whole store. So I opened their app, trying to search for it online, which led me to learn and search for the word **apron**. I still didn't get a new **apron**. But it's okay. I will get it tomorrow. | May 5, 2024 |
| [cranky](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cranky) | crankier, crankiest, crankily, crankiness | mood                 | I watched an episode of the latest season of Young Sheldon during my dinner. Sheldon's sister Missy described Meemaw as **cranky** because she was mad at her boyfriend for making jokes about her not having tornado insurance after her house was torn down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | May 5, 2024 |
