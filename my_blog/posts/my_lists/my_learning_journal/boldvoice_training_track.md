Although many of my American friends constantly tell me that my English is very good, I have always known that it needs to be improved and have yet to take much action. But this year, I met a few very friendly and honest people who directly or indirectly suggested I improve my English, which greatly motivated me.

I was told and believed that a person's accent can not be removed or changed. However, after some logical reasoning, I concluded this is untrue. I will add my reasons here later.

Therefore, I am currently using an app called BoldVoice to train myself. It has been so much fun! I subscribed to it for one year. On this page, I want to track the effort and progress I make to improve my English speaking. I will also consider seeing a speaking or accent therapist in the future. I aim to communicate clearly and confidently to exchange ideas with more excellent people!

My current plan (updated on May 19, 2024) to improve my English is in the following steps:

1. Learn the American accent on a daily basis to train my muscles and change my pronunciation habits:
   - Using BoldVoice to learn the basics and get feedback;
   - Following and mimicking people speaking in movies, shows, talks, lectures, daily conversations, etc.;
   - Practicing linking sounds by following YouTube videos and BoldVoice app;
   - Talking with ChatGPT in various ways for constructive feedbacks and suggestions to improve my pronunciation;
   - Using voice typing to check if the voice recognition algorithms can understand my pronunciation. If not, I learn the correct pronunciation and practice them;
   - Talking to native speakers several times a week.
2. Solidate my grammar to build the foundation for smooth sentences and confident expressions:
   - Find some books, notes, exercises, quizzes, or games to systematically reinforce my understanding and memory of grammar rules in English.
   - Writing many articles, documents, and blogs to improve my ability to structure and express my thoughts and ideas elegantly and efficiently.
   - Using Grammarly and Copilot (powered by ChatGPT) to correct my mistakes, give me suggestions to improve the quality of my writing, and learn from them.
   - Looking up words and how they are used in dictionaries. I am currently using LONGMAN 6 and WordWebUS. They are super useful tools.
3. Increase my vocabulary by looking up and mindfully remembering new words I encounter everywhere.
4. Watch YouTute Videos and listening to Podcasts on tips and other people's advices to learn English. This has been super helpful!
