Although many of my American friends constantly tell me that my English is very good, I have always known that it needs to be improved and have not yet taken much action. But this year, I met a few very friendly and honest people who directly or indirectly suggested I improve my English, which greatly motivated me. Therefore, I am currently using an app called BoldVoice to train myself. It has been so much fun! I subscribed to it for one year. On this page, I want to track the effort and progress I make to improve my English speaking. I will also consider seeing a speaking or accent therapist in the future. I aim to communicate clearly and confidently to exchange ideas with more excellent people!
