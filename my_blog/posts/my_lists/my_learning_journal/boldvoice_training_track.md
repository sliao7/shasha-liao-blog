Although many of my American friends constantly tell me that my English is very good, I have always known that my English is not good enough and didn't take much action to improve it. But this year, I met a few very good and honest people who told me that I should improve my English. I think this is a good time to embrace the American accent. I am currently using an app called BoldVoice to train myself. It has been so much fun! I subscribed to it for a year. On this page, I want to track the effort and progress I make to improve my English speaking.
