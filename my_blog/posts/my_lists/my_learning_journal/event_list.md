| 2024-05-14  | Leading The Way; Executive Chat with Katherine Liu | Katherine Liu (Chief Operating Officer, International Markets) | Paramount Global Inclusion | Vimeo | 1 hour | Life journey, leadership, and problem-solving| Leadership | Katherine has a lot of wisdom to share. She suggested us constantly think about problems like: What kind of life do I want to live? How do I spend my time? How do I spend my energy? How do I spend my money? What kind of values am I building my life plan upon? These questions really resonated with me because I also started thinking about them frequently several months ago and have benefited a lot from that.|
