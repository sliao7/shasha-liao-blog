# It's About Energy

I recently started thinking about the following questions:

1. What kinds of energy do I bring to people?
2. What kind of energy do others usually bring to me?
3. What are the different impacts of different kinds of energy?
4. How to mindfully recognize and adjust the kind of energy we convey to other people?
5. What is the best way to respond to other people's energy?

<!-- The fun thing is that I am not often aware of the situation or try to change the situation. Instead, I usually just follow the flow and respond to situations very naturally.  -->
